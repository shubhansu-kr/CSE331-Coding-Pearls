> Sem 6 : Competetive Programming Batch C3  
> **L:** 2 **T:** 0 **P:** 1 **Credits:** 3  

This Repo tracks the progress of course cse331 and contains the solution to the problems discussed during the lectures.

Coding Pearls was the third course in competetive programming batch and aimed towards creating a better understanding of advanced data structures. 

## Course Outcomes
Through this course students should be able to:
- **CO1:** Relate the theoretical as well as practical knowledge to form an amalgamation of working code.
- **CO2:** Employ a working combination of solutions to ubiquitous problems which are time and space efficient.
- **CO3:** Identify and comprehend the inner workings behind the design of an optimal solution.
- **CO4:** Illustrate the usage of algorithms and data structures in the design of an optimal solution towards a problem.
- **CO5:** Recall the knowledge obtained from various algorithmic paradigms to formulate optimal solutions to real-world problems.
- **CO6:** Examine and utilise knowledge to build and design reliable code which is capable of passing various test cases.
